## Description
The chosen one was wandering through the streets of Kashi when he stumbled upon something surreal. In the depths of this city as old as time itself, he found this even older temple sealed shut with the divine seal. Just above the seal was written "If thou seekâ€™st the light of knowledge, thou must chant this ancient mantra with a soul most pure." The mystic standing beside the door gave him the mantra and the enchantments on impure tounge for the Seal. Help the chosen one to find the impure word of our language which on performing the enchantments shall give him the mantra. 

## Solution
