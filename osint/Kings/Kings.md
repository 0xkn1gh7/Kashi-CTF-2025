## Description
Did you know the cosmic weapons like this? I found similar example of such weapons on the net and it was even weirder. This ruler's court artist once drew the most accurate painting of a now extinct bird. Can you tell me the coordinates upto 10 decimal places of the place where this painting is right now.

## Solution 
Search on google and wikipedia. First we get Tutankhamun then we get Jahangir then we see the painter Ustad Mansur and finally the extinct bird dodo. This painting is a prestent in Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg, Russia.
