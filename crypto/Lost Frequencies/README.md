`111 0000 10 111 1000 00 10 01 010 1011 11 111 010 000 0`

NOTE: Wrap the flag in KashiCTF{}

## Flag

`KashiCTF{OHNOBINARYMORSE}`

## Solution

The only hint here is "Zeroes, ones, dots and dashes". On replacing zeroes with dots and ones with dashes, a morse code is obtained which on decoding reveals the flag.
